2024-12-02 12:48:33 - INFO - Prompt content: Take the below rough specifications, clean them up, and write them as you would write professional specifications 
                             to be handed to a software developer. Take your time, and be as detailed as possible:

                        -- SPECS BELOW --

                        Using Python and FastAPI, you must build an API with 1 endpoint. It is defined below:

1. Transcribe - Accepts an input stream of wav audio data. This endpoint will use Faster Whisper with the repo/model: "deepdml/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo-ct2". The parameters for this model are below:
    - Compute Type: int8_float16.
    - Device: "cuda".
As the audio data stream is received, the chunks should be appended to an audio_buffer - which should happen continuously until this API call is complete. FasterWhisper comes bundled with the Silero VAD model for detecting human speech, and this should be used to detect speech. When speech is FIRST detected in the incoming audio stream, a speech_detected boolean should be set to True. From this point on:
    -   If speech is NOT detected for a continuous period of 200ms or longer, and a boolean called processed is set to false, the audio_buffer data should be transcribed by the model and stored in a result variable. The boolean processed should then be set to true.
    -   If speech is detected before 800ms of no speech pass: processed should be set to false, and if a transcription is currently in progress, it should be canceled. Audio then continues to be received and appended to the buffer until another 200ms of no speech occurs.
    -   If 800ms of no speech pass: the last transcription result should be returned to the user as a text response. If the transcription is still going, wait for it, and then return it once completed. At this point, it doesn't matter if speech is detected again.
    -   If the audio input stream ends at any point, then none of the above speech detection logic applies: the audio_buffer should be passed to the model to transcribe, and - once finished - the result should be returned to the client/user.

Additional API Details:

- Ensure that the model is downloaded into a "models" subdirectory if it doesn't already exist, and load it from there. 
- The model should be loaded when the API starts up, and only one instance should be used.
- Access to this API should be by API key - which should be stored in a dict on the server. Handle authentication by API key for the endpoint - returning appropriate errors if not present or correct.

## Overview
This document outlines the specifications for a FastAPI-based audio transcription service that utilizes the Faster Whisper model for real-time speech-to-text conversion with voice activity detection.

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- Faster Whisper (Model: deepdml/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo-ct2)
- Silero VAD (bundled with Faster Whisper)

## Authentication
- Authentication Method: API Key
- Implementation: API keys stored in a server-side dictionary
- Header Name: `X-API-Key`
- Error Responses:
  - 401 Unauthorized: Missing API key
  - 403 Forbidden: Invalid API key

## Model Configuration
### Initialization
- Model should be initialized once during API startup
- Model Location: `./models/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo-ct2`
- Model Parameters:
  - Compute Type: int8_float16
  - Device: cuda
- The API should automatically download the model if not present in the models directory

## API Endpoint

### Transcribe Audio
**Endpoint**: `/transcribe`
**Method**: POST
**Content-Type**: `audio/wav`

#### Request
- Body: Streaming WAV audio data
- Headers:
  - Required: `X-API-Key`
  - Optional: None

#### Processing Logic
1. Audio Buffer Management:
   - Continuously append incoming audio chunks to an audio_buffer
   - Maintain buffer throughout the duration of the API call

2. Speech Detection Logic:
   - Utilize Silero VAD for speech detection
   - Initialize `speech_detected = False`
   - Initialize `processed = False`

3. Processing Rules:
   a. When speech is first detected:
      - Set `speech_detected = True`
      - Begin monitoring for speech gaps

   b. During speech gaps:
      - If speech absence \u2265 200ms AND `processed = False`:
        * Initiate transcription of audio_buffer
        * Store result in 'result' variable
        * Set `processed = True`

      - If speech detected before 800ms gap AND `processed = True`:
        * Cancel any ongoing transcription
        * Set `processed = False`
        * Continue buffering audio

      - If speech absence \u2265 800ms:
        * Return most recent transcription result
        * If transcription in progress, wait for completion
        * Ignore subsequent speech detection

   c. Stream termination:
      - If audio stream ends, bypass speech detection logic
      - Transcribe entire audio_buffer
      - Return result immediately

#### Response
**Success Response (200 OK)**
```json
{
    "text": "string",  // Transcribed text
    "status": "success"
}
```

**Error Responses**
```json
401 Unauthorized:
{
    "detail": "Missing API key"
}

403 Forbidden:
{
    "detail": "Invalid API key"
}

422 Unprocessable Entity:
{
    "detail": "Invalid audio format"
}

500 Internal Server Error:
{
    "detail": "Transcription failed"
}
```

## Error Handling
- Implement appropriate error handling for:
  - Invalid audio format
  - Model loading failures
  - Transcription errors
  - Authentication failures
  - Network interruptions

## Performance Considerations
- Ensure efficient memory management for audio buffer
- Implement proper cleanup of resources
- Handle concurrent requests appropriately

## Security Considerations
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate input audio format
- Sanitize all outputs
- Secure API key storage
- Implement appropriate logging

## Dependencies
- List all required Python packages in requirements.txt
- Include version numbers for all dependencies

This specification should be implemented with proper error handling, logging, and documentation following Python best practices and FastAPI conventions.
